\href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/}{\texttt{ C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE}} is a design and simulation framework for closed-\/loop peripheral neuromodulation control systems. At its center is {\itshape concore}, a lightweight protocol to simulate neuromodulation control systems. This repository consists of the implementation of {\itshape concore} protocol and sample (demo and neuromodulation control systems) studies. In addition to its default standard Python implementation, {\itshape concore} also supports developing studies in Matlab/\+Octave, Verilog, and C++. {\itshape concore} also aims to support more language programs in the future.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysection{The C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+R\+E Framework}\label{md_README_autotoc_md21}
The C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE framework consists of the below projects.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape concore}\+: The C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE protocol, known as {\itshape concore}, allows modular simulation of controller and PM nodes to run on different operating systems, computing platforms, and programming languages. \href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/}{\texttt{ This repository}} consists of {\itshape concore} source code. The {\itshape concore} documentation can be found \href{https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}{\texttt{ here}}. A {\itshape concore} study can be developed from programs written in different languages. That means, {\itshape concore} facilitates a seamless communication across codes developed in different languages that it supports, through its simple file-\/based data sharing between the programs.
\item {\itshape concore} Editor\+: This is the front-\/end for C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE. We forked \href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/DHGWorkflow}{\texttt{ D\+H\+G\+Workflow}}, a sibling project we developed, and extend it as the {\itshape concore} Editor.
\item {\itshape Mediator}\+: The \href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/mediator}{\texttt{ Mediator}} allows the C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE studies to be distributed and run, rather than having all the programs that construct a study to be run just from a centralized location.
\item {\itshape concore-\/lite}\+: The \href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore-lite}{\texttt{ {\itshape concore-\/lite}}} repository consists of a simple example version of a {\itshape concore} study. Please check out and run this, if you like to learn the {\itshape concore} protocol without having to clone this large {\itshape concore} repository.
\item documentation\+: The \href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/documentation}{\texttt{ source code repository}} of the Read\+The\+Docs documentation of C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE.

{\itshape concore} enables composing studies from programs developed in different languages. Currently supported languages are, Python, Matlab/\+Octave, Verilog, and C++. The studies are designed through the visual {\itshape concore} Editor (D\+H\+G\+Workflow) and interpreted into {\itshape concore} through its parser. Neural control systems consist of loops (dicycles). Therefore, they cannot be represented by classic workflow standards (such as C\+WL or W\+DL). Therefore, {\itshape concore} addresses a significant research gap to model closed-\/loop neuromodulation control systems. The {\itshape concore} protocol shares data between the programs through file sharing, with no centralized entity (a broker or an orchestrator) to arbitrate communications between the programs. (In the distributed executions, the C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE Mediator enables connecting the disjoint pieces of the study through R\+E\+ST A\+P\+Is).\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysection{Installation and Getting Started Guide}\label{md_README_autotoc_md23}

This paper has a complete discussion on the C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE architecture and deployment, together with the commands to execute the studies in different programming languages and programming environments (Ubuntu, Windows, Mac\+OS, Docker, and distributed execution).\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{The $<$em$>$concore$<$/em$>$ Repository}\label{md_README_autotoc_md24}
{\itshape concore} contains programs (such as physiological models or more commonly called \char`\"{}\+P\+Ms\char`\"{} and controllers) and studies (i.\+e., graphml files that represents the studies as workflows). The {\itshape wrappers} enable seamlessly extending a study into a distributed one with the C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE Mediator.

{\itshape concore} repository consists of several scripts at its root level. The demo folder consists of several sample programs and studies, mostly toy examples to learn the protocol. The ratc folder consists of the programs and studies of the rat cardiac experiments we developed with {\itshape concore}.
