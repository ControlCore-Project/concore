Have you got requests for enhancements or encountered a bug? Please open an issue in the \href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/issues}{\texttt{ bug tracker}} if it is not already reported there.

If you have questions and clarifications that are not bug reports, please use our \href{https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/discussions}{\texttt{ Discussions forum}}.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Commits and pull requests}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md11}
New contributors are encouraged to submit pull requests, rather than directly committing even when you have committer access. Another developer can then review and merge your pull request.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{Community Outreach}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md12}
The C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L-\/\+C\+O\+RE project has tremendously benefitted from open-\/source. We have been a part of the Google Summer of Code (G\+SoC), via the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University as the mentoring organization. D\+H\+G\+Workflow (which is adopted as the {\itshape concore} Editor) was developed by the G\+SoC 2021 contributor. For G\+SoC 2022, we have 2 contributors -\/ one working on {\itshape concore} Editor and the other one on the {\itshape concore} itself.

Please use the Git\+Hub discussion forums for user-\/queries. For G\+SoC and similar open-\/source contributions, as well as for other real-\/time user queries, feel free to join the G\+SoC Emory B\+MI slack workspace using the link -\/ \href{http://bit.ly/emory-bmi}{\texttt{ http\+://bit.\+ly/emory-\/bmi}} and find the channel \char`\"{}concore.\char`\"{}
