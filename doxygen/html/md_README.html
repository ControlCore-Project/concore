<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p><a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/">CONTROL-CORE</a> is a design and simulation framework for closed-loop peripheral neuromodulation control systems. At its center is <em>concore</em>, a lightweight protocol to simulate neuromodulation control systems. This repository consists of the implementation of <em>concore</em> protocol and sample (demo and neuromodulation control systems) studies. In addition to its default standard Python implementation, <em>concore</em> also supports developing studies in Matlab/Octave, Verilog, and C++. <em>concore</em> also aims to support more language programs in the future.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
The CONTROL-CORE Framework</h1>
<p>The CONTROL-CORE framework consists of the below projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>concore</em>: The CONTROL-CORE protocol, known as <em>concore</em>, allows modular simulation of controller and PM nodes to run on different operating systems, computing platforms, and programming languages. <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/">This repository</a> consists of <em>concore</em> source code. The <em>concore</em> documentation can be found <a href="https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">here</a>. A <em>concore</em> study can be developed from programs written in different languages. That means, <em>concore</em> facilitates a seamless communication across codes developed in different languages that it supports, through its simple file-based data sharing between the programs.</li>
<li><em>concore</em> Editor: This is the front-end for CONTROL-CORE. We forked <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/DHGWorkflow">DHGWorkflow</a>, a sibling project we developed, and extend it as the <em>concore</em> Editor.</li>
<li><em>Mediator</em>: The <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/mediator">Mediator</a> allows the CONTROL-CORE studies to be distributed and run, rather than having all the programs that construct a study to be run just from a centralized location.</li>
<li><em>concore-lite</em>: The <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore-lite"><em>concore-lite</em></a> repository consists of a simple example version of a <em>concore</em> study. Please check out and run this, if you like to learn the <em>concore</em> protocol without having to clone this large <em>concore</em> repository.</li>
<li>documentation: The <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/documentation">source code repository</a> of the ReadTheDocs documentation of CONTROL-CORE.</li>
</ul>

The &lt;em&gt;concore&lt;/em&gt; Protocol</h1>
<p><em>concore</em> enables composing studies from programs developed in different languages. Currently supported languages are, Python, Matlab/Octave, Verilog, and C++. The studies are designed through the visual <em>concore</em> Editor (DHGWorkflow) and interpreted into <em>concore</em> through its parser. Neural control systems consist of loops (dicycles). Therefore, they cannot be represented by classic workflow standards (such as CWL or WDL). Therefore, <em>concore</em> addresses a significant research gap to model closed-loop neuromodulation control systems. The <em>concore</em> protocol shares data between the programs through file sharing, with no centralized entity (a broker or an orchestrator) to arbitrate communications between the programs. (In the distributed executions, the CONTROL-CORE Mediator enables connecting the disjoint pieces of the study through REST APIs).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Installation and Getting Started Guide</h1>
<p>Please follow the <a href="https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">ReadTheDocs</a> documentation and the <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore-lite"><em>concore-lite</em></a> repository to get started quick.</p>
<p>Installation instructions for concore can be found <a href="https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">here</a>. Usage instructions can be found <a href="https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>For a detailed and more scientific documentation, please read our extensive <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161471">open-access research paper on CONTROL-CORE</a>. This paper has a complete discussion on the CONTROL-CORE architecture and deployment, together with the commands to execute the studies in different programming languages and programming environments (Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS, Docker, and distributed execution).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
The &lt;em&gt;concore&lt;/em&gt; Repository</h1>
<p><em>concore</em> contains programs (such as physiological models or more commonly called "PMs" and controllers) and studies (i.e., graphml files that represents the studies as workflows). The <em>wrappers</em> enable seamlessly extending a study into a distributed one with the CONTROL-CORE Mediator.</p>
<p><em>concore</em> repository consists of several scripts at its root level. The demo folder consists of several sample programs and studies, mostly toy examples to learn the protocol. The ratc folder consists of the programs and studies of the rat cardiac experiments we developed with <em>concore</em>.</p>
<p>If you have a bug to report in one of the CONTROL-CORE projects, please report it through relevant Issue Tracker. Similarly, please feel free to contribute your studies and code enhancements using pull requests. Questions and discussions can be made through the relevant Discussions forum.</p>
<p>The <em>concore</em> Issues can be reported <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/issues">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>concore</em> discussion forum can be found <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/discussions">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please make sure to send your <em>concore</em> pull requests to the <a href="https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/concore/tree/dev">dev branch</a>.</p>
