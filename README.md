# _concore_
CONTROL-CORE is a framework for closed-loop peripheral neuromodulation control systems. The CONTROL-CORE protocol, known as _concore_, allows modular simulation of controller and PM nodes to run on different operating systems, computing platforms, and programming languages. 


# Configuring _concore_

concore is a lightweight Python-based protocol to simulate neuromodulation control systems. Installation instructions for concore can be found [here](https://control-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
